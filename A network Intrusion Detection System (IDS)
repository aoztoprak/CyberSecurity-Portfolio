# AI-Assisted Incident Response Investigation Example

## Incident Overview
A network Intrusion Detection System (IDS/IPS) generated an alert due to suspicious outbound network traffic connecting an internal host to a known malicious IP address. This example illustrates how an Incident Response Analyst can integrate AI tools into daily alert investigations.

## Step 1: IDS Detection Rule (Suricata)

```yaml
alert ip any any -> [198.51.100.45] any (msg:"ET MALWARE Suspicious Connection to Known Malicious IP"; classtype:trojan-activity; sid:2025001; rev:1;)
```

**AI Integration:**
- AI-enhanced rule management tools dynamically update detection signatures based on threat intelligence feeds.

## Step 2: Sample Raw Log from SIEM (Splunk)

```json
Mar 15 12:34:56 firewall01 ids-alert: {
  "timestamp":"2025-03-15T12:34:56Z",
  "src_ip":"192.168.10.25",
  "src_port":49231,
  "dest_ip":"198.51.100.45",
  "dest_port":443,
  "protocol":"TCP",
  "alert_signature":"ET MALWARE Suspicious Connection to Known Malicious IP",
  "severity":"high"
}
```

**AI Integration:**
- Natural language processing (NLP)-based log analysis tools identify and prioritize alerts for rapid analyst response.

## Step 3: Network Traffic Analysis (PCAP)

- **File:** `incident_malicious_connection.pcap`
- **Description:** TCP traffic capturing SSL handshake attempts and encrypted payload between host `192.168.10.25` and malicious IP `198.51.100.45`.
- **Malicious Indicators:** Persistent communication indicative of potential Command and Control (C2) activity.

**AI Integration:**
- AI-powered packet analysis platforms automatically extract suspicious network behavior patterns and indicators from PCAP files, highlighting anomalies requiring human intervention.

## Step 4: OSINT Search Results

- **Malicious IP:** `198.51.100.45`
- Verified through threat intelligence services (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX).
- Associated with malware distribution, C2 infrastructure, and advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.

**AI Integration:**
- AI-driven threat intelligence platforms aggregate and correlate real-time threat data, providing context-rich intelligence for informed decision-making.

## Incident Response Steps Leveraging AI Tools

### 1. Preparation
- Validated detection and monitoring tools using AI-enhanced diagnostic checks.
- Verified host isolation and containment playbooks through automated AI-based simulations.

### 2. Identification
- Reviewed IDS alerts and SIEM logs with AI-driven analytics to swiftly pinpoint suspicious activities.
- Conducted automated PCAP analysis using machine learning algorithms to identify anomalous network behaviors indicative of compromise.

### 3. Containment
- Automated isolation of the compromised host using AI-powered orchestration tools.
- AI-assisted firewall policy updates to proactively block malicious IP address.

### 4. Eradication
- Conducted deep forensic analysis on the compromised host using AI-based endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
- AI-assisted malware removal ensured comprehensive eradication of threats.

### 5. Recovery
- Validated restoration from clean backups using AI-integrated system integrity verification tools.
- Implemented additional AI-enhanced security controls to proactively detect future anomalies.

### 6. Lessons Learned
- AI-driven retrospective analysis to identify gaps in existing firewall rules and detection capabilities.
- Enhanced preventive strategies through the implementation of AI-based anomaly detection and predictive analytics.

## Final Resolution Summary

Leveraging AI tools throughout the incident response lifecycle enabled rapid detection, containment, and remediation of a sophisticated threat involving malicious network connections. The integration of AI significantly reduced response time and improved accuracy, allowing incident responders to focus on strategic tasks and proactively prevent future incidents.
